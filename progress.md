# azguard Project Progress

## Project Overview

**azguard** - One command to make sure your Azure free tier doesn't surprise you with a bill.

### The Pivot

This project was previously "Agent CLI" - a general-purpose tool for software development and cloud cost management. After strategic analysis, it has been pivoted to focus specifically on **Azure free tier bill protection**.

### Why This Pivot?

- **Clear pain point**: Azure free tier confusion is well-documented
- **Defined audience**: Students, freelancers, bootcamp grads, small dev shops
- **Low competition**: No CLI tool specifically for this use case
- **Viral potential**: Every Azure bill shock forum post is distribution
